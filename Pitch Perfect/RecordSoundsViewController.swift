//  Allow the user to record audio with the microphone to a WAV file. The file can be played back at a later time.
//
//  The recorder transitions through three states:
//      1. Stopped state: The recorder is idle and no audio is being recorded. The record button is enabled. Tapping the
//         record button transitions to the Recording state.
//      2. Recording state: Audio is being recorded. While in this state, the record button is disabled, and the stop 
//         button is enabled. Tapping on the stop button transitions to the Saving state. If for some reason the 
//         recorder fails to initialize, an error is displayed and the view controller transitions back to the stopped 
//         state.
//      3. Saving state: Audio is saved to a file. During this state the record button and stop button are disabled, and
//         an activity indicator appears. When the recording is saved, the view controller returns to the stopped state.
//         If the recording is saved successfully, then the app transitions to the playback view controller. If the 
//         recording cannot be saved, then an error is displayed and the app remains on the current view controller.
